The concepts studied are

2) Different types of time series -- white noise, random walk, autoregressive models, 
and moving average models. 
3) Worked with real-world datasets such as EuStockMarkets, AirPassengers, and Nile. 
4) Using the arima function predicted and forecasted the values for
different data sets.
