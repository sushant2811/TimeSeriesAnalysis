---------------------------

Start by looking at raw time series

```{r}
print(Nile)
```

Data about the water flow in river Nile from 1871 to 1970

```{r}
length(Nile)
```

```{r}
head(Nile)
```

displaying first few values using head

```{r}
head(Nile, n = 10)
```

Displaying the last few values using the tail command

```{r}
tail(Nile)
```

```{r}
plot(Nile, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'River Volume (1e9 m^{3})', main = 'Annual River Nile Volume at Aswan, 1871-1970')
```

Plotting both points and the line

```{r}
plot(Nile, xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'River Volume (1e9 m^{3})', main = 'Annual River Nile Volume at Aswan, 1871-1970',  type = 'b')
# b stands for both: line and points
```
